#AI HEALTH RISK PREDICTOR
##Overview of the Project
The AI Health Risk Predictor is a lightweight, user-friendly desktop application that uses a trained Random Forest Classifier to predict an individual's health risk level (Low, Moderate, or High) based on basic physiological and lifestyle inputs.
It combines real-time BMI calculation with an AI model to provide instant, color-coded health risk feedback which is perfect for health awareness apps, educational demos, or medical prototyping.
This project demonstrates the integration of AI with a graphical user interface (GUI) in pure Python and it requires no web framework required.
#Features
•	Real-time BMI calculation with category display.
•	Interactive sliders for Height, Weight, and Age.
•	Gender and Activity Level selection via dropdown.
•	Pre-trained Random Forest model for health risk prediction.
•	Instant visual feedback with color-coded results.
•	Smooth and responsive GUI built with Tkinter.
•	Lightweight and runs offline.
#Technologies / Tools Used
TECHNOLOGY	PURPOSE
PYTHON 3.X	Core programming language
TKINTER	GUI framework (built-in with Python)
NUMPY	Numerical operations & data handling
SCIKIT-LEARN	Random Forest Classifier (ML model)
TTK (TKINTER)	Modern-styled widgets (Combobox, etc)

#Steps to Install & Run the Project
Prerequisites
•	Python 3.6 or higher
•	pip (Python package manager)
Installation Steps (for libraries):
•	pip install numpy scikit-learn (in cmd).
•	Now just copy the code from github and run.
##Instructions for Testing
-	Run the code and You’ll see default values and initial prediction.
- Move the Height, Weight, and Age sliders and  Watch BMI and risk update in real-time.
